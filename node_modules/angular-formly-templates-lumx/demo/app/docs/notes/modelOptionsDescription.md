Default model options are already pretty good. `AllowInvalid: false & updateOn: blur`. Even so, sometimes you may want to adjust your model options.

In the example below:

* All fields should only validate when all characters are numbers. Just type a non-number to get a validation message.
* Watch the changes in `formData`
